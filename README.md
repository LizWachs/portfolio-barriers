Code for portfolio optimization was adapted from Mathworks, 2020. Design Optimization of a Welded Beam. [Online] Available at: https://www.mathworks.com/help/gads/multiobjective-optimization-welded-beam.html [Accessed 19 June 2020].
Analysis of results was performed using barrier_calc.m. It relies on the Pareto_Solns function which simply finds the Pareto front from the solutions given. The barrier_calc.m file must be run on results files built from running the portfolio optimization codes.
